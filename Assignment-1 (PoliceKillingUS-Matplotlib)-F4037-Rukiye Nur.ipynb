    "\"In 2015, The Washington Post began to log [every fatal shooting](https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/national/police-shootings-year-end/) by an on-duty police officer in the United States. In that time there have been [more than 5,000 such shootings](https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2019/08/09/what-weve-learned-about-police-shootings-years-after-ferguson/?arc404=true) recorded by The Post. After [Michael Brown, an unarmed Black man, was killed](https://www.washingtonpost.com/policeshootings/) in 2014 by police in Ferguson, Mo., a Post investigation found that the [FBI undercounted fatal police shootings](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2014/09/08/how-many-police-shootings-a-year-no-one-knows/) by more than half. This is because reporting by police departments is voluntary and many departments fail to do so. The Washington Post’s data relies primarily on news accounts, social media postings and police reports. Analysis of more than five years of data reveals that the number and circumstances of fatal shootings and the overall demographics of the victims have remained relatively constant...\" [SOURCE ==> Washington Post Article](https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/investigations/police-shootings-database/)\n",

That would include incidents where officers or others were shot at, threatened with a gun, attacked with other weapons or physical force, etc. The attack category is meant to flag the highest level of threat. The other and undetermined categories represent all remaining cases. Other includes many incidents where officers or others faced significant threats.\n",

Also, attacks represent a status immediately before fatal shots by police while fleeing could begin slightly earlier and involve a chase.\n",
